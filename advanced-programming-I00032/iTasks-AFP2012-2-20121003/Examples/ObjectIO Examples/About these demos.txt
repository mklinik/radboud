About these demos
=================

This folder contains the sources of example programs that demonstrate the features of the Clean Object I/O System.

The following example programs have been converted from the 0.8 I/O library to the Object I/O library
to give you some impression of the differences between the two libraries. We intend to convert all
0.8 example programs in time. 
	* 'gui utilities':	This folder contains a number of useful modules for interactive applications:
		* Help:			A function to create a Dialog that displays information about the application and 
						a function to create a Window that displays information about the use of the application.
						Both the 'about' and 'help' information reside in the same file. 
		* Highscore:	Functions to read and write high scores to disk, and to present a list of high scores
						in a dialog.
		* Random:		Functions to generate random numbers. 
	* hanoi:			Hanoi gives a graphical representation of the famous 'towers of hanoi'.
	* life:				Life gives a graphical user interface to play with Conway's Game of Life.
	* simple database:	This program browses and changes one database at a time.
	* turing:			This program is a simple programming environment and interpreter for Turing Machines.
	* worm:				This program is a simple game with a worm having to eat food. No fancy graphics involved.

New example programs that demonstrate more typical Object I/O features such as process creation, message passing,
and local state, are the following:
	* bounce:			This program creates two interactive processes. Each process contains a barrel in which
						balls are bouncing against the walls and each other. When a ball leaves the barrel it is
						sent to the other process.
	* clipboard viewer:	This program shows the current content of the clipboard and lets you change it.
	* compare:			This program compares two different text files. 
	* counter:			This program opens a window with a composite counter control with a local integer state.
	* 'gui utilities':	Two new modules have been added to this folder:
		* ListBox:		A new Controls instance that can be used in windows and dialogues to display a list of
						items in a scrollable control. 
		* Notice:		A new Dialogs instance that can be used to display simple messages and have button 
						alternatives.
	* hello world:		The famous "Hello World!" example program as an interactive program.
	* rgb selector:		This program opens a dialog to create RGB colours. 
	* scrabble:			A more extensive application which implements the well-known game Scrabble. 
	* slidegame:		This program makes use of bitmaps for a simple slide game.
	* talk:				This program creates two interactive processes. Each process contains a window in which the
						user can type text that is being sent to the other process. In the window the received 
						text from the other process is also displayed.
	* typist:			This program creates two interactive processes. One process presents a window in which text
						can be typed. The other process monitors the typing speed of the other process during a
						session of one minute.
